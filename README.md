Consuming Office 365 REST API in Windows Phone, Android and IOS using Xamarin Forms
======================

This sample is based in this article:
[Mail, Calendar, and Contact REST APIs](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/office/dn605896(v=office.15).aspx#bkContact)



This sample was created after I tried to use the Office365 API Preview, see more in my initial sample that is now updated (but not complete!):
